        <h2>Website Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The website I want to make is a online recipe book/archive that is simple and easily searchable. No fluff, no stories, just recipes.<br />
            All the content for this site will be user submitted. Users can submit their favorite recipes so that all users of the site can easily access and enjoy them.<br /><br />
            As said by chef and internet personality Josh Scherer, <q>We all gotta eat, and we're all gonna die</q><br />
            Everyone needs to eat but it's sometimes hard to figure out what you want to make.<br /><br />
            If this site can help people easily find recipes, who wouldn't want to use it?<br /><br />
            "There's already so many websites for recipes already, why make another?"<br />
            To put it plainly: recipe website's suck. There full of ads, unnecessary stories, hostile UI, and just bloat in general.<br />
            I want to make something simple and easy to use without the excess.<br />
            I would like users to submit their recipes to my website, so that others can find them and make them.<br /><br />
            The goal of this site is to make finding and keeping recipes simpler and more accessible.
